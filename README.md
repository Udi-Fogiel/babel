## Babel 24.10.63051

(dev)

`babel` is the multilingual framework for localizing documents in
LaTeX, LuaLaTeX, XeLaTeX. It manages culturally-determined
typographical (and other) rules for about 170 to 300 languages,
depending on the engine, with several levels of coverage. A few
languages even work with Plain formats.

The latest stable version is available on <https://ctan.org/pkg/babel>.

Changes in version 24.10 are described in:

https://latex3.github.io/babel/news/whats-new-in-babel-24.10.html

Apart from the manual, you can find information on some aspects of babel at:

The best way to install and/or update it is with the help of package
managers.
